    // Diff between primitive and non-primitive data types mainly depends on memory allocation, and primitive data types are often known as reference type data type.
    // Array can store all types of data, whereas ArrayList can only store non-primitive data types (no int, char, etc.; only Integer, Character, etc.)
    // linked lists are linear data structures like arraylists. They are also lists that are dynamic in size, but they store elements in nodes that are connected via pointers, rather than in contiguous memory locations like arraylists.
    // Linked lists allow for efficient insertions and deletions at any position in the list, whereas arraylists may require shifting elements to accommodate such operations.
    // However, linked lists have slower access times for elements at specific indices compared to arraylists, which provide constant-time access due to their contiguous memory allocation.

    //linked lists have 1. data 2. reference/pointer to next node and also sometimes 3. reference/pointer to previous node (doubly linked list)
    //Refer to class2.drawio for visual representation
    // Value in linked list = node, value in arraylist = element
    // Linked lists always have a head node (first node) [ArrayList[0]] and tail node (last node) [ArrayList.size()-1]
    // If we set the 2nd node to be the head node, the original head node will be lost and we will not be able to access it anymore.
    // Pros: We can access first and last elements instantly
    // Cons: We cannot access middle elements instantly, we have to traverse from head/tail to that element
