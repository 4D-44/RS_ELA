The repo I made for my Experiential Learning Activity (Competitive Problem Solving [Coding]) during my 3rd semester, the Residential Semester of BracU — RS70

## Assignment 1 solution methods
### 1a
Ans: O(nlogn)

Exp: Outer loop runs n * 1/2 times, so O(n). Inner loop runs ~~√n times, so O(√n).~~ logn times because of the step being a product of 2. Therefore, final time complexity: n*logn
### 1b
Ans: O(√n)

Exp: The step is squaring itself, so time complexity is √n

### 2
Exp: ~~i cant do ts gng 🥀~~
